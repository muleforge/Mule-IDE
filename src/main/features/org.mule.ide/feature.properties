date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this\n\
License. \n\
\n\
(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1)\n\
for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original\n\

by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\
\n\
3.  Distribution Obligations.\n\
\n\
3.1 Application of License.\n\
The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by\n\
the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2.  The Source\n\
Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this\n\
License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You\n\
must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n\
distribute.  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version\n\
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the\n\
recipients' rights hereunder.  However, You may include an additional document\n\
offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5. \n\
\n\
3.2 Availability of Source Code.\n\
Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made\n\
available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same\n\
media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\n\
Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if\n\
made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for\n\
at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at\n\
least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n\
has been made available to such recipients.  You are responsible for ensuring\n\
that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\n\
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. \n\
\n\
3.3 Description of Modifications.\n\
You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file\n\
documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any\n\
change.  You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is\n\
derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial\n\
Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\n\
Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in\n\
which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code. \n\
\n\
3.4 Intellectual Property Matters\n\
\n\
(a) Third Party Claims.\n\
If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual\n\
property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor\n\
under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source\n\
Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making\n\
the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.  If\n\
Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as\n\
described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in\n\
all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n\
(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably\n\
calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has\n\
been obtained. \n\
\n\
(b) Contributor APIs. \n\
If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and\n\
Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to\n\
implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL\n\
file. \n\
\n\
(c) Representations. \n\
Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)\n\
above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's\n\
original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the\n\
rights conveyed by this License.\n\
\n\
3.5 Required Notices. \n\
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If\n\
it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to\n\
its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a\n\
relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If\n\
You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor\n\
to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in\n\
any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or\n\
ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n\
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one\n\
or more recipients of Covered Code.  However, You may do so only on Your own\n\
behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.  You must\n\
make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n\
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the\n\
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n\
Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n\
indemnity or liability terms You offer. \n\
\n\
3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. \n\
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of\n\
Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice\n\
stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the\n\
terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have\n\
fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2.  The notice must be conspicuously\n\
included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n\
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered\n\
Code.  You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership\n\
rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from\n\
this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\n\
and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or\n\
alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n\
forth in this License.  If You distribute the Executable version under a\n\
different license  You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n\
from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer,\n\
Original Developer or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the\n\
Initial Developer, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability\n\
incurred by the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a\n\
result of any such terms You offer. \n\
\n\
3.7 Larger Works. \n\
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not\n\
governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single\n\
product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are\n\
fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\
\n\
4.  Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. \n\
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with\n\
respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or\n\
regulation then You must:  (a) comply with the terms of this License to the\n\
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\n\
affect.  Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in\n\
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. \n\
Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must\n\
be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n\
understand it.\n\
\n\
5.  Application of this License. \n\
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the\n\
notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\
\n\
6.  Versions of the License. \n\
\n\
6.1 New Versions. \n\
MuleSoft, Inc. ("MuleSoft") may publish revised and/or new versions of the\n\
License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version\n\
number.\n\
\n\
6.2 Effect of New Versions.  \n\
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,\n\
You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version.  You may also\n\
choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the\n\
License published by Socialtext.  No one other than MuleSoft has the right to\n\
modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License. \n\
\n\
6.3 Derivative Works. \n\
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do\n\
in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this\n\
License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "MuleSoft",\n\
"CPAL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except\n\
to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it\n\
clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n\
CPAL.  (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer,\n\
Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of\n\
themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\
\n\
7.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. \n\
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT\n\
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n\
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,\n\
FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\n\
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE\n\
PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL\n\
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n\
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\n\
OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER\n\
THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\
\n\
8.  TERMINATION. \n\
\n\
8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\n\
if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30\n\
days of becoming aware of the breach.  All sublicenses to the Covered Code which\n\
are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License.  Provisions\n\
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this\n\
License shall survive. \n\
\n\
8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim\n\
(excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original\n\
Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or\n\
Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant")\n\
alleging that: \n\
\n\
(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes\n\
any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under\n\
Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from\n\
Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of\n\
notice You either:  (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable\n\
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n\
Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the\n\
Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a\n\
reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\n\
writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights\n\
granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically\n\
terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above. \n\
\n\
(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n\
Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any\n\
rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are\n\
revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had\n\
made, Modifications made by that Participant. \n\
\n\
8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that\n\
such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any\n\
patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to\n\
the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of\n\
the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be\n\
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n\
license. \n\
\n\
8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user\n\
license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n\
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall\n\
survive termination.\n\
\n\
9.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. \n\
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\n\
NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL\n\
DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY\n\
SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,\n\
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,\n\
WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n\
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN\n\
IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS\n\
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\n\
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n\
PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n\
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND\n\
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\
\n\
10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. \n\
The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.\n\
2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial\n\
computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n\
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through\n\
227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with\n\
only those rights set forth herein.\n\
\n\
11. MISCELLANEOUS. \n\
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.\n\
If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision\n\
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.  This\n\
License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent\n\
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law\n\
provisions.  With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen\n\
of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of\n\
America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the\n\
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with\n\
venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible\n\
for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\n\
fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts\n\
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or\n\
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed\n\
against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\
\n\
12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. \n\
As between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each\n\
party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out\n\
of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with\n\
Initial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n\
responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or shall be\n\
deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\
\n\
13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. \n\
Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n\
Multiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits\n\
you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the\n\
alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file\n\
described in Exhibit A.\n\
\n\
14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION\n\
\n\
(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the\n\
Original Code ("Original Developer"), in the hope that its promotional value may\n\
help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code,\n\
the Original Developer may include in Exhibit B ("Attribution Information") a\n\
requirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is\n\
launched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent\n\
display of the Original Developer's Attribution Information (as defined below)\n\
must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such\n\
Covered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any.  The size\n\
of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of\n\
the Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and\n\
Source Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered\n\
Code, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such\n\
Attribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash\n\
screen, notice at login, an "about" display, or dedicated attribution area on\n\
user interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution\n\
Information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.\n\
\n\
(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief\n\
phrase, graphic image and a URL ("Attribution Information") and is subject to\n\
the Attribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall\n\
mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of\n\
the identity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution\n\
Information or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the\n\
Attribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent\n\
than such Attribution Information or similar information for the other party. \n\
For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in Exhibit B\n\
below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an Executable and\n\
Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification, but not a\n\
Larger Work.  The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution,\n\
therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display, at any time,\n\
more than the following information as Attribution Information:  (a) a copyright\n\
notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or one phrase\n\
(not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the Original\n\
Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the "Attribution Limits").\n\
\n\
(c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there\n\
are no requirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the\n\
Original Developer.\n\
\n\
(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names\n\
contained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code\n\
are the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the\n\
permission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or\n\
as expressly set out in this License.\n\
\n\
15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.\n\
The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, or communication of\n\
the Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or\n\
Modifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are\n\
distributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application\n\
intended for use over a network.  As an express condition for the grants of\n\
license hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original\n\
Code or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code\n\
available under Section 3.2.\n\
 \n\
