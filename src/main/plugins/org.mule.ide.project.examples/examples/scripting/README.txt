| Scripting Example |
+-------------------+
A simple example that demonstrates Mule's JSR-223 Scripting support.

For more information, refer to http://www.muledocs.org/Examples

+----------------------+
| Building the example |
+----------------------+
First, make sure you have set the MULE_HOME environment variable as recommended 
in INSTALL.txt

Depending on the build tool you are using (Ant or Maven), you can build the 
example by simply running "ant" or "mvn".  This will download any additional 
libraries, compile the example classes, produce a jar file, and copy everything 
to $MULE_HOME/lib/user, which is where your custom classes and configuration 
files should go.

(If you are unable to download the libraries it may be because you are behind a 
firewall and have not configured your build tool to use your HTTP proxy.  Please 
refer to the following information.)

    Maven users:   http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html

+---------------------+
| Running the example |
+---------------------+
Simply use the shell script (Unix/Linux) or batch file (Windows) provided in 
this directory to run the example.

Alternatively, if you have added Mule to your executable path as recommended in 
INSTALL.txt, you can run the example from the command line as follows:

    Linux / Unix
    ------------
    mule -config file:conf/scripting-config.xml
     or
    export MULE_LIB=./conf
    mule -config scripting-config.xml

    Windows
    -------
    mule.bat -config file:conf/scripting-config.xml
     or
    SET MULE_LIB=.\conf
    mule.bat -config scripting-config.xml
