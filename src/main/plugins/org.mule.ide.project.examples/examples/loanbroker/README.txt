| Loan Broker Example |
+---------------------+
This simple application is based on the Loan Broker example presented in the 
Enterprise Integration Patterns book.

There are several variations of the same application which illustrate different 
architectural styles and Mule constructs.

| Building the example |
+----------------------+
First, make sure you have set the MULE_HOME environment variable as recommended 
in INSTALL.txt

Depending on the build tool you are using (Ant or Maven), you can build the 
example by simply running "ant" or "mvn".  This will download any additional 
libraries, compile the example classes, produce a jar file(s), and copy 
everything to $MULE_HOME/lib/user, which is where your custom classes and 
configuration files should go.  

(If you are unable to download the libraries it may be because you are behind a 
firewall and have not configured your build tool to use your HTTP proxy.  Please 
refer to the following information.)
