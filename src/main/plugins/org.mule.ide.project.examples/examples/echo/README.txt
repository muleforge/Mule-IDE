| Echo Example |
+--------------+
This example demonstrates how to expose a Mule component over multiple 
transports, in this case as an Axis web sevice and via System.in (request) and 
System.out (response).

+---------------------+
| Running the example |
+---------------------+
Simply use the shell script (Unix/Linux) or batch file (Windows) provided in 
this directory to run the example.

Alternatively, if you have added Mule to your executable path as recommended in 
INSTALL.txt, you can run the example from the command line as follows:

    Linux / Unix
    ------------
    mule -config file:conf/echo-config.xml
     or
    export MULE_LIB=./conf
    mule -config echo-config.xml

    Windows
    -------
    mule.bat -config file:conf/echo-config.xml
     or
    SET MULE_LIB=.\conf
    mule.bat -config echo-config.xml

| Building the example |

This example has no custom classes so there's not much point in building it.
